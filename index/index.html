<p id="text1">To me, Traveling is a very enjoyable activity. I love traveling with my parents and my best friends. It helps us to get away from the daily rush of life. Besides, there are many reasons to love traveling. Firstly, I like finding out about food cultures everywhere. For example, I am interested in Chinese food that has Yang Chow fried rice. Colorful, pillowy and delicately flavored, Yang Chow fried rice is perhaps one of the most famous and treasured Chinese foods. Secondly, I will meet many new friends when traveling. It is a great thing when I realize that I have new friends across the globe. I can come to know about their cultures and historical sites by interacting with them. In conclusion, I’m a huge fan of traveling and I will make plans to travel to as many places as I can whenever I’m free.</p>
